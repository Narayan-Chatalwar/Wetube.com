Hello everyone <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

This project was build by me when i was in unit-3 at masai school.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This project is inspired by Youtube.com which is a famous video streaming and sharing platform. we have also used youtube api for fetching all the data from server.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Basically I used the concepts of api calling. In this project I used the basic concepts of website building like HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is how The Website Looks...
